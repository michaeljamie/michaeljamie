## Welcome to my Github Profile 👋
I'm a software engineer at [Nokē](https://noke.com/), one of the fastest growing startups in the country.  I love the combination of creative skills combined with logical problem solving used in coding and the feeling of constantly studying, learning, and regularly growing my knowledge. 📚

## About me

When I’m not working, I also enjoy spending time with my wife and son, coding, traveling ✈️, hiking, mountain biking, camping ⛺, outdoor photography, kayaking, cooking, gaming 🎮, and being around friends and family.
