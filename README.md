## Hi, I'm Mikey 👋
I'm a software engineer at [Angel Studios](https://angel.com/).  I love the combination of creative skills combined with logical problem solving used in coding and the feeling of constantly studying, learning, and regularly growing my knowledge. 📚

## About me

When I’m not working, I also enjoy spending time with my wife and son, coding, traveling ✈️, hiking, mountain biking, camping ⛺, outdoor photography, kayaking, cooking, gaming 🎮, and being around friends and family.
